    Welcome to the Cadmus playground. This web UI supports the development of
    the Cadmus editing system. It will grow together with the system itself, and
    serve as a prototype for testing.
  </p>
  <p>The general edit model has these layers:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>items: the list of the records.</li>
    <li>
      item: edit the metadata of a single item, view its parts, delete a part
      from it, or add a part to it.
    </li>
    <li>part: edit a new or existing part in an item.</li>
    <li>
      fragment: for text layers, edit a new or existing fragment in a part.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    From the <kbd>demo</kbd> menu, you can access every single data model
    editor, whether it refers to a part or a fragment, in a general-purpose
    testbed UI. This provides two views of the model: one is its raw JSON
    representation, while the other is its graphical editing UI. You can freely
    edit the model using the graphical UI and get the corresponding JSON; or
    viceversa.
